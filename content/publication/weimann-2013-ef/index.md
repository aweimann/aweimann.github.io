abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Understanding the biological mechanisms used by microorganisms
  for plant biomass degradation is of considerable biotechnological interest. Despite
  of the growing number of sequenced (meta)genomes of plant biomass-degrading microbes,
  there is currently no technique for the systematic determination of the genomic
  components of this process from these data. RESULTS: We describe a computational
  method for the discovery of the protein domains and CAZy families involved in microbial
  plant biomass degradation. Our method furthermore accurately predicts the capability
  to degrade plant biomass for microbial species from their genome sequences. Application
  to a large, manually curated data set of microbial degraders and non-degraders identified
  gene families of enzymes known by physiological and biochemical tests to be implicated
  in cellulose degradation, such as GH5 and GH6. Additionally, genes of enzymes that
  degrade other plant polysaccharides, such as hemicellulose, pectins and oligosaccharides,
  were found, as well as gene families which have not previously been related to the
  process. For draft genomes reconstructed from a cow rumen metagenome our method
  predicted Bacteroidetes-affiliated species and a relative to a known plant biomass
  degrader to be plant biomass degraders. This was supported by the presence of genes
  encoding enzymatically active glycoside hydrolases in these genomes. CONCLUSIONS:
  Our results show the potential of the method for generating novel insights into
  microbial plant biomass degradation from (meta-)genome data, where there is an increasing
  production of genome assemblages for uncultured microbes.'
