 abstract = {Background: To elucidate biogas microbial communities and
processes, the application of high-throughput DNA analysis
approaches is becoming increasingly important. Unfortunately,
generated data can only partialy be interpreted rudimentary
since databases lack reference sequences. Results: Novel
cellulolytic, hydrolytic, and acidogenic/acetogenic Bacteria as
well as methanogenic Archaea originating from different
anaerobic digestion communities were analyzed on the genomic
level to assess their role in biomass decomposition and biogas
production. Some of the analyzed bacterial strains were recently
described as new species and even genera, namely Herbinix
hemicellulosilytica T3/55T, Herbinix luporum SD1DT, Clostridium
bornimense M2/40T, Proteiniphilum saccharofermentans M3/6T,
Fermentimonas caenicola ING2-E5BT, and Petrimonas mucosa
ING2-E5AT. High-throughput genome sequencing of 22 anaerobic
digestion isolates enabled functional genome interpretation,
metabolic reconstruction, and prediction of microbial traits
regarding their abilities to utilize complex bio-polymers and to
perform specific fermentation pathways. To determine the
prevalence of the isolates included in this study in different
biogas systems, corresponding metagenome fragment mappings were
done. Methanoculleus bourgensis was found to be abundant in
three mesophilic biogas plants studied and slightly less
abundant in a thermophilic biogas plant, whereas Defluviitoga
tunisiensis was only prominent in the thermophilic system.
Moreover, several of the analyzed species were clearly
detectable in the mesophilic biogas plants, but appeared to be
only moderately abundant. Among the species for which genome
sequence information was publicly available prior to this study,
only the species Amphibacillus xylanus, Clostridium clariflavum,
and Lactobacillus acidophilus are of importance for the biogas
microbiomes analyzed, but did not reach the level of abundance
as determined for M. bourgensis and D. tunisiensis. Conclusions:
Isolation of key anaerobic digestion microorganisms and their
functional interpretation was achieved by application of
elaborated cultivation techniques and subsequent genome
analyses. New isolates and their genome information extend the
repository covering anaerobic digestion community members.},
