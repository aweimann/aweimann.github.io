abstract: The medical and scientific response to emerging and established pathogens
  is often severely hampered by ignorance of the genetic determinants of virulence,
  drug resistance and clinical outcomes that could be used to identify therapeutic
  drug targets and forecast patient trajectories. Taking the newly emergent multidrug-resistant
  bacteria Mycobacterium abscessus as an example, we show that combining high-dimensional
  phenotyping with whole-genome sequencing in a phenogenomic analysis can rapidly
  reveal actionable systems-level insights into bacterial pathobiology. Through phenotyping
  of 331 clinical isolates, we discovered three distinct clusters of isolates, each
  with different virulence traits and associated with a different clinical outcome.
  We combined genome-wide association studies with proteome-wide computational structural
  modelling to define likely causal variants, and employed direct coupling analysis
  to identify co-evolving, and therefore potentially epistatic, gene networks. We
  then used in vivo CRISPR-based silencing to validate our findings and discover clinically
  relevant M. abscessus virulence factors including a secretion system, thus illustrating
  how phenogenomics can reveal critical pathways within emerging pathogenic bacteria.
