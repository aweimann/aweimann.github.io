 abstract = {The medical and scientific response to emerging and established
pathogens is often severely hampered by ignorance of the genetic
determinants of virulence, drug resistance and clinical outcomes
that could be used to identify therapeutic drug targets and
forecast patient trajectories. Taking the newly emergent
multidrug-resistant bacteria Mycobacterium abscessus as an
example, we show that combining high-dimensional phenotyping with
whole-genome sequencing in a phenogenomic analysis can rapidly
reveal actionable systems-level insights into bacterial
pathobiology. Through phenotyping of 331 clinical isolates, we
discovered three distinct clusters of isolates, each with
different virulence traits and associated with a different
clinical outcome. We combined genome-wide association studies
with proteome-wide computational structural modelling to define
likely causal variants, and employed direct coupling analysis to
identify co-evolving, and therefore potentially epistatic, gene
networks. We then used in vivo CRISPR-based silencing to validate
our findings and discover clinically relevant M. abscessus
virulence factors including a secretion system, thus illustrating
how phenogenomics can reveal critical pathways within emerging
pathogenic bacteria.},
