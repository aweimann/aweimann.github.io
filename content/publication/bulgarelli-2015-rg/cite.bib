 abstract = {The microbial communities inhabiting the root interior of
healthy plants, as well as the rhizosphere, which consists of
soil particles firmly attached to roots, engage in symbiotic
associations with their host. To investigate the structural and
functional diversification among these communities, we employed
a combination of 16S rRNA gene profiling and shotgun metagenome
analysis of the microbiota associated with wild and domesticated
accessions of barley (Hordeum vulgare). Bacterial families
Comamonadaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Rhizobiaceae dominate the
barley root-enriched microbiota. Host genotype has a small, but
significant, effect on the diversity of root-associated
bacterial communities, possibly representing a footprint of
barley domestication. Traits related to pathogenesis, secretion,
phage interactions, and nutrient mobilization are enriched in
the barley root-associated microbiota. Strikingly, protein
families assigned to these same traits showed evidence of
positive selection. Our results indicate that the combined
action of microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions drives
microbiota differentiation at the root-soil interface.},
