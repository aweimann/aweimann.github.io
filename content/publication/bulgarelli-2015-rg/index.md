abstract: The microbial communities inhabiting the root interior of healthy plants,
  as well as the rhizosphere, which consists of soil particles firmly attached to
  roots, engage in symbiotic associations with their host. To investigate the structural
  and functional diversification among these communities, we employed a combination
  of 16S rRNA gene profiling and shotgun metagenome analysis of the microbiota associated
  with wild and domesticated accessions of barley (Hordeum vulgare). Bacterial families
  Comamonadaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Rhizobiaceae dominate the barley root-enriched
  microbiota. Host genotype has a small, but significant, effect on the diversity
  of root-associated bacterial communities, possibly representing a footprint of barley
  domestication. Traits related to pathogenesis, secretion, phage interactions, and
  nutrient mobilization are enriched in the barley root-associated microbiota. Strikingly,
  protein families assigned to these same traits showed evidence of positive selection.
  Our results indicate that the combined action of microbe-microbe and host-microbe
  interactions drives microbiota differentiation at the root-soil interface.
