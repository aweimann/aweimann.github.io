abstract: Although almost all mycobacterial species are saprophytic environmental
  organisms, a few, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have evolved to cause transmissible
  human infection. By analyzing the recent emergence and spread of the environmental
  organism M. abscessus through the global cystic fibrosis population, we have defined
  key, generalizable steps involved in the pathogenic evolution of mycobacteria. We
  show that epigenetic modifiers, acquired through horizontal gene transfer, cause
  saltational increases in the pathogenic potential of specific environmental clones.
  Allopatric parallel evolution during chronic lung infection then promotes rapid
  increases in virulence through mutations in a discrete gene network; these mutations
  enhance growth within macrophages but impair fomite survival. As a consequence,
  we observe constrained pathogenic evolution while person-to-person transmission
  remains indirect, but postulate accelerated pathogenic adaptation once direct transmission
  is possible, as observed for M. tuberculosis Our findings indicate how key interventions,
  such as early treatment and cross-infection control, might restrict the spread of
  existing mycobacterial pathogens and prevent new, emergent ones.
