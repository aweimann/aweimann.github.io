 abstract = {Although almost all mycobacterial species are saprophytic
environmental organisms, a few, such as Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, have evolved to cause transmissible human
infection. By analyzing the recent emergence and spread of the
environmental organism M. abscessus through the global cystic
fibrosis population, we have defined key, generalizable steps
involved in the pathogenic evolution of mycobacteria. We show
that epigenetic modifiers, acquired through horizontal gene
transfer, cause saltational increases in the pathogenic potential
of specific environmental clones. Allopatric parallel evolution
during chronic lung infection then promotes rapid increases in
virulence through mutations in a discrete gene network; these
mutations enhance growth within macrophages but impair fomite
survival. As a consequence, we observe constrained pathogenic
evolution while person-to-person transmission remains indirect,
but postulate accelerated pathogenic adaptation once direct
transmission is possible, as observed for M. tuberculosis Our
findings indicate how key interventions, such as early treatment
and cross-infection control, might restrict the spread of
existing mycobacterial pathogens and prevent new, emergent ones.},
