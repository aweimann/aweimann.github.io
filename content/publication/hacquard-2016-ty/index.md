abstract: The sessile nature of plants forced them to evolve mechanisms to prioritize
  their responses to simultaneous stresses, including colonization by microbes or
  nutrient starvation. Here, we compare the genomes of a beneficial root endophyte,
  Colletotrichum tofieldiae and its pathogenic relative C. incanum, and examine the
  transcriptomes of both fungi and their plant host Arabidopsis during phosphate starvation.
  Although the two species diverged only 8.8 million years ago and have similar gene
  arsenals, we identify genomic signatures indicative of an evolutionary transition
  from pathogenic to beneficial lifestyles, including a narrowed repertoire of secreted
  effector proteins, expanded families of chitin-binding and secondary metabolism-related
  proteins, and limited activation of pathogenicity-related genes in planta. We show
  that beneficial responses are prioritized in C. tofieldiae-colonized roots under
  phosphate-deficient conditions, whereas defense responses are activated under phosphate-sufficient
  conditions. These immune responses are retained in phosphate-starved roots colonized
  by pathogenic C. incanum, illustrating the ability of plants to maximize survival
  in response to conflicting stresses.
