 abstract = {The sessile nature of plants forced them to evolve mechanisms to
prioritize their responses to simultaneous stresses, including
colonization by microbes or nutrient starvation. Here, we
compare the genomes of a beneficial root endophyte,
Colletotrichum tofieldiae and its pathogenic relative C.
incanum, and examine the transcriptomes of both fungi and their
plant host Arabidopsis during phosphate starvation. Although the
two species diverged only 8.8 million years ago and have similar
gene arsenals, we identify genomic signatures indicative of an
evolutionary transition from pathogenic to beneficial
lifestyles, including a narrowed repertoire of secreted effector
proteins, expanded families of chitin-binding and secondary
metabolism-related proteins, and limited activation of
pathogenicity-related genes in planta. We show that beneficial
responses are prioritized in C. tofieldiae-colonized roots under
phosphate-deficient conditions, whereas defense responses are
activated under phosphate-sufficient conditions. These immune
responses are retained in phosphate-starved roots colonized by
pathogenic C. incanum, illustrating the ability of plants to
maximize survival in response to conflicting stresses.},
