 abstract = {Population-level comparisons of prokaryotic genomes must take
into account the substantial differences in gene content
resulting from horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication and
gene loss. However, the automated annotation of prokaryotic
genomes is imperfect, and errors due to fragmented assemblies,
contamination, diverse gene families and mis-assemblies
accumulate over the population, leading to profound consequences
when analysing the set of all genes found in a species. Here, we
introduce Panaroo, a graph-based pangenome clustering tool that
is able to account for many of the sources of error introduced
during the annotation of prokaryotic genome assemblies. Panaroo
is available at https://github.com/gtonkinhill/panaroo .},
