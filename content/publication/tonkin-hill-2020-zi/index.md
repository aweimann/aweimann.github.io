abstract: Population-level comparisons of prokaryotic genomes must take into account
  the substantial differences in gene content resulting from horizontal gene transfer,
  gene duplication and gene loss. However, the automated annotation of prokaryotic
  genomes is imperfect, and errors due to fragmented assemblies, contamination, diverse
  gene families and mis-assemblies accumulate over the population, leading to profound
  consequences when analysing the set of all genes found in a species. Here, we introduce
  Panaroo, a graph-based pangenome clustering tool that is able to account for many
  of the sources of error introduced during the annotation of prokaryotic genome assemblies.
  Panaroo is available at https://github.com/gtonkinhill/panaroo .
