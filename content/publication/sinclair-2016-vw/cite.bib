 abstract = {Understanding the distribution of taxa and associated traits
across different environments is one of the central questions in
microbial ecology. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies are
presently generating huge volumes of data to address this
biogeographical topic. However, these studies are often focused
on specific environment types or processes leading to the
production of individual, unconnected datasets. The large
amounts of legacy sequence data with associated metadata that
exist can be harnessed to better place the genetic information
found in these surveys into a wider environmental context. Here
we introduce a software program, seqenv, to carry out precisely
such a task. It automatically performs similarity searches of
short sequences against the ``nt'' nucleotide database provided
by NCBI and, out of every hit, extracts-if it is available-the
textual metadata field. After collecting all the isolation
sources from all the search results, we run a text mining
algorithm to identify and parse words that are associated with
the Environmental Ontology (EnvO) controlled vocabulary. This,
in turn, enables us to determine both in which environments
individual sequences or taxa have previously been observed and,
by weighted summation of those results, to summarize complete
samples. We present two demonstrative applications of seqenv to
a survey of ammonia oxidizing archaea as well as to a plankton
paleome dataset from the Black Sea. These demonstrate the
ability of the tool to reveal novel patterns in HTS and its
utility in the fields of environmental source tracking,
paleontology, and studies of microbial biogeography. To install
