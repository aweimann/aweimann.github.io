abstract: "Understanding the distribution of taxa and associated traits across different
  environments is one of the central questions in microbial ecology. High-throughput
  sequencing (HTS) studies are presently generating huge volumes of data to address
  this biogeographical topic. However, these studies are often focused on specific
  environment types or processes leading to the production of individual, unconnected
  datasets. The large amounts of legacy sequence data with associated metadata that
  exist can be harnessed to better place the genetic information found in these surveys
  into a wider environmental context. Here we introduce a software program, seqenv,
  to carry out precisely such a task. It automatically performs similarity searches
  of short sequences against the ``nt'' nucleotide database provided by NCBI and,
  out of every hit, extracts-if it is available-the textual metadata field. After
  collecting all the isolation sources from all the search results, we run a text
  mining algorithm to identify and parse words that are associated with the Environmental
  Ontology (EnvO) controlled vocabulary. This, in turn, enables us to determine both
  in which environments individual sequences or taxa have previously been observed
  and, by weighted summation of those results, to summarize complete samples. We present
  two demonstrative applications of seqenv to a survey of ammonia oxidizing archaea
  as well as to a plankton paleome dataset from the Black Sea. These demonstrate the
  ability of the tool to reveal novel patterns in HTS and its utility in the fields
  of environmental source tracking, paleontology, and studies of microbial biogeography.
