abstract: Abstract Genetic determinants of susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  (Mtb) are poorly understood but could provide insights into critical pathways involved
  in infection, informing host-directed therapies and enabling risk stratification
  at individual and population levels. Through a genome-wide forward genetic screen,
  we identify the Toll-like Receptor 8 (TLR8), as a key regulator of intracellular
  killing of Mtb. Pharmacological TLR8 activation enhances killing of phylogenetically
  diverse clinical isolates of drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant Mtb by macrophages
  and during in vivo infection in mice. TLR8 is activated by phagosomal mycobacterial
  RNA released by extracellular membrane vesicles, and enhances xenophagy-dependent
  Mtb killing. We find that the TLR8 variant, M1V, common in far eastern populations,
  enhances intracellular killing of Mtb through preferential signal-dependent trafficking
  to phagosomes. TLR8 signalling may therefore both regulate susceptibility to tuberculosis
  and provide novel drug targets.Single sentence summary RNA released from Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis in the macrophage phagosome is sensed by the pattern recognition receptor
  TLR8 controlling host susceptibility to tuberculosis and revealing a druggable pathway
  for host-directed therapy.
