 abstract = {Abstract Genetic determinants of susceptibility to Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) are poorly understood but could provide
insights into critical pathways involved in infection, informing
host-directed therapies and enabling risk stratification at
individual and population levels. Through a genome-wide forward
genetic screen, we identify the Toll-like Receptor 8 (TLR8), as a
key regulator of intracellular killing of Mtb. Pharmacological
TLR8 activation enhances killing of phylogenetically diverse
clinical isolates of drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant Mtb
by macrophages and during in vivo infection in mice. TLR8 is
activated by phagosomal mycobacterial RNA released by
extracellular membrane vesicles, and enhances xenophagy-dependent
Mtb killing. We find that the TLR8 variant, M1V, common in far
eastern populations, enhances intracellular killing of Mtb
through preferential signal-dependent trafficking to phagosomes.
TLR8 signalling may therefore both regulate susceptibility to
tuberculosis and provide novel drug targets.Single sentence
summary RNA released from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the
macrophage phagosome is sensed by the pattern recognition
receptor TLR8 controlling host susceptibility to tuberculosis and
revealing a druggable pathway for host-directed therapy.},
