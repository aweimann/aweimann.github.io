title: Predicting antimicrobial resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa with machine
  learning-enabled molecular diagnostics
summary:  By training machine learning classifiers on information
  about the presence or absence of genes, their sequence variation, and expression
  profiles, we generated predictive models and identified biomarkers of resistance
  to four commonly administered antimicrobial drugs.

abstract: Limited therapy options due to antibiotic resistance underscore the need
  for optimization of current diagnostics. In some bacterial species, antimicrobial
  resistance can be unambiguously predicted based on their genome sequence. In this
  study, we sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of 414 drug-resistant clinical
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. By training machine learning classifiers on information
  about the presence or absence of genes, their sequence variation, and expression
  profiles, we generated predictive models and identified biomarkers of resistance
  to four commonly administered antimicrobial drugs. Using these data types alone
  or in combination resulted in high (0.8-0.9) or very high (> 0.9) sensitivity and
  predictive values. For all drugs except for ciprofloxacin, gene expression information
  improved diagnostic performance. Our results pave the way for the development of
  a molecular resistance profiling tool that reliably predicts antimicrobial susceptibility
  based on genomic and transcriptomic markers. The implementation of a molecular susceptibility
  test system in routine microbiology diagnostics holds promise to provide earlier
  and more detailed information on antibiotic resistance profiles of bacterial pathogens
  and thus could change how physicians treat bacterial infections.
