 abstract = {Limited therapy options due to antibiotic resistance underscore
the need for optimization of current diagnostics. In some
bacterial species, antimicrobial resistance can be unambiguously
predicted based on their genome sequence. In this study, we
sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of 414 drug-resistant
clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. By training machine
learning classifiers on information about the presence or
absence of genes, their sequence variation, and expression
profiles, we generated predictive models and identified
biomarkers of resistance to four commonly administered
antimicrobial drugs. Using these data types alone or in
combination resulted in high (0.8-0.9) or very high (> 0.9)
sensitivity and predictive values. For all drugs except for
ciprofloxacin, gene expression information improved diagnostic
performance. Our results pave the way for the development of a
molecular resistance profiling tool that reliably predicts
antimicrobial susceptibility based on genomic and transcriptomic
markers. The implementation of a molecular susceptibility test
system in routine microbiology diagnostics holds promise to
provide earlier and more detailed information on antibiotic
resistance profiles of bacterial pathogens and thus could change
how physicians treat bacterial infections.},
