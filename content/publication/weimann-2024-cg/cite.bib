 abstract = {The major human bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes
multidrug-resistant infections in people with underlying
immunodeficiencies or structural lung diseases such as cystic
fibrosis (CF). We show that a few environmental isolates, driven
by horizontal gene acquisition, have become dominant epidemic
clones that have sequentially emerged and spread through global
transmission networks over the past 200 years. These clones
demonstrate varying intrinsic propensities for infecting CF or
non-CF individuals (linked to specific transcriptional changes
enabling survival within macrophages); have undergone multiple
rounds of convergent, host-specific adaptation; and have
eventually lost their ability to transmit between different
patient groups. Our findings thus explain the pathogenic
evolution of P. aeruginosa and highlight the importance of global
surveillance and cross-infection prevention in averting the
emergence of future epidemic clones. Individuals with cystic
fibrosis and other chronic inflammatory lung diseases are
particularly vulnerable to colonization by Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. Epidemic clones have emerged in certain patient
groups that are associated with poor clinical outcomes and
antimicrobial resistance. Weimann et al. investigated when and
how such clones emerge by accessing international collections of
clinical and environmental strains of P. aeruginosa amassed over
the past century. The authors distinguished 21 major clones based
on pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphism distances and majority
multilocus sequence type. A series of epidemic clones emerged and
expanded between 1850 and 2000, indicating recent selective
pressures, possibly driven by industrialization, associated
pollution, and human population change and underpinned by major
changes in bacterial physiology. —Caroline Ash},
