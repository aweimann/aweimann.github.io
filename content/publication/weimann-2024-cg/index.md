title: Evolution and host-specific adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
summary: We describe how Pseudmonas aeruginosa has evolved over the last 200 years into a global pathogen via horizontal gene transfer and then further specialised to infect people with cystic fibrosis or without via convergent molecular evolution.

abstract: The major human bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes multidrug-resistant
  infections in people with underlying immunodeficiencies or structural lung diseases
  such as cystic fibrosis (CF). We show that a few environmental isolates, driven
  by horizontal gene acquisition, have become dominant epidemic clones that have sequentially
  emerged and spread through global transmission networks over the past 200 years.
  These clones demonstrate varying intrinsic propensities for infecting CF or non-CF
  individuals (linked to specific transcriptional changes enabling survival within
  macrophages); have undergone multiple rounds of convergent, host-specific adaptation;
  and have eventually lost their ability to transmit between different patient groups.
  Our findings thus explain the pathogenic evolution of P. aeruginosa and highlight
  the importance of global surveillance and cross-infection prevention in averting
  the emergence of future epidemic clones. Individuals with cystic fibrosis and other
  chronic inflammatory lung diseases are particularly vulnerable to colonization by
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Epidemic clones have emerged in certain patient groups that
  are associated with poor clinical outcomes and antimicrobial resistance. Weimann
  et al. investigated when and how such clones emerge by accessing international collections
  of clinical and environmental strains of P. aeruginosa amassed over the past century.
  The authors distinguished 21 major clones based on pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphism
  distances and majority multilocus sequence type. A series of epidemic clones emerged
  and expanded between 1850 and 2000, indicating recent selective pressures, possibly
  driven by industrialization, associated pollution, and human population change and
  underpinned by major changes in bacterial physiology. —Caroline Ash
