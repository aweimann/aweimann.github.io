 abstract = {AbstractRapid detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and
understanding the mecha- nisms underlying antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) are major unsolved problems that pose
significant threats to global public health. However, existing
methods for predicting antibiotic resistance from genomic
sequence data have had lim- ited success due to their inability
to model epistatic effects and generalize to novel variants.
Here, we present GeneBac, a deep learning method for predicting
antibiotic resistance from DNA sequence through the integration
of interactions between genes. We apply GeneBac to two distinct
bacterial species and show that it can successfully predict the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of multiple antibiotics.
We use the WHO Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutation cat- alogue to
demonstrate that GeneBac accurately predicts the effects of
different variants, including novel variants that have not been
observed during training. GeneBac is a modular framework which
can be applied to a number of tasks including gene expression
prediction, resistant gene identification and strain clus-
tering. We leverage this modularity to transfer learn from the
transcriptomic data to improve performance on the MIC prediction
task.},
