abstract: AbstractRapid detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and understanding
  the mecha- nisms underlying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are major unsolved problems
  that pose significant threats to global public health. However, existing methods
  for predicting antibiotic resistance from genomic sequence data have had lim- ited
  success due to their inability to model epistatic effects and generalize to novel
  variants. Here, we present GeneBac, a deep learning method for predicting antibiotic
  resistance from DNA sequence through the integration of interactions between genes.
  We apply GeneBac to two distinct bacterial species and show that it can successfully
  predict the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of multiple antibiotics. We use
  the WHO Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutation cat- alogue to demonstrate that GeneBac
  accurately predicts the effects of different variants, including novel variants
  that have not been observed during training. GeneBac is a modular framework which
  can be applied to a number of tasks including gene expression prediction, resistant
  gene identification and strain clus- tering. We leverage this modularity to transfer
  learn from the transcriptomic data to improve performance on the MIC prediction
  task.
