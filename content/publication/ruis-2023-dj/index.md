abstract: As observed in cancers, individual mutagens and defects in DNA repair create
  distinctive mutational signatures that combine to form context-specific spectra
  within cells. We reasoned that similar processes must occur in bacterial lineages,
  potentially allowing decomposition analysis to detect both disruption of DNA repair
  processes and exposure to niche-specific mutagens. Here we reconstruct mutational
  spectra for 84 clades from 31 diverse bacterial species and find distinct mutational
  patterns. We extract signatures driven by specific DNA repair defects using hypermutator
  lineages, and further deconvolute the spectra into multiple signatures operating
  within different clades. We show that these signatures are explained by both bacterial
  phylogeny and replication niche. By comparing mutational spectra of clades from
  different environmental and biological locations, we identify niche-associated mutational
  signatures, and then employ these signatures to infer the predominant replication
  niches for several clades where this was previously obscure. Our results show that
  mutational spectra may be associated with sites of bacterial replication when mutagen
  exposures differ, and can be used in these cases to infer transmission routes for
  established and emergent human bacterial pathogens.
