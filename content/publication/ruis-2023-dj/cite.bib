 abstract = {As observed in cancers, individual mutagens and defects in DNA
repair create distinctive mutational signatures that combine to
form context-specific spectra within cells. We reasoned that
similar processes must occur in bacterial lineages, potentially
allowing decomposition analysis to detect both disruption of DNA
repair processes and exposure to niche-specific mutagens. Here we
reconstruct mutational spectra for 84 clades from 31 diverse
bacterial species and find distinct mutational patterns. We
extract signatures driven by specific DNA repair defects using
hypermutator lineages, and further deconvolute the spectra into
multiple signatures operating within different clades. We show
that these signatures are explained by both bacterial phylogeny
and replication niche. By comparing mutational spectra of clades
from different environmental and biological locations, we
identify niche-associated mutational signatures, and then employ
these signatures to infer the predominant replication niches for
several clades where this was previously obscure. Our results
show that mutational spectra may be associated with sites of
bacterial replication when mutagen exposures differ, and can be
used in these cases to infer transmission routes for established
and emergent human bacterial pathogens.},
