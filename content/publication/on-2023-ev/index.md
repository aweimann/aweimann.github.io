abstract: Once acquired, hypermutation is unrelenting, and in the long-term, leads
  to impaired fitness due to its cumulative impact on the genome. This raises the
  question of why hypermutators arise so frequently in microbial ecosystems. In this
  work, we explore this problem by examining how the transient acquisition of hypermutability
  affects inter- and intra-species competitiveness, and the response to environmental
  insults such as antibiotic challenge. We do this by engineering Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  to allow the expression of an important mismatch repair gene, mutS, to be experimentally
  controlled over a wide dynamic range. We show that high levels of mutS expression
  induce genomic stasis (hypomutation), whereas lower levels of induction lead to
  progressively higher rates of mutation. Whole-genome sequence analyses confirmed
  that the mutational spectrum of the inducible hypermutator is similar to the distinctive
  profile associated with mutS mutants obtained from the airways of people with cystic
  fibrosis (CF). The acquisition of hypermutability conferred a distinct temporal
  fitness advantage over the wild-type P. aeruginosa progenitor strain, in both the
  presence and the absence of an antibiotic selection pressure. However, over a similar
  time-scale, acquisition of hypermutability had little impact on the population dynamics
  of P. aeruginosa when grown in the presence of a competing species (Staphylococcus
  aureus). These data indicate that in the short term, acquired hypermutability primarily
  confers a competitive intra-species fitness advantage.
