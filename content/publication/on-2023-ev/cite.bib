 abstract = {Once acquired, hypermutation is unrelenting, and in the
long-term, leads to impaired fitness due to its cumulative impact
on the genome. This raises the question of why hypermutators
arise so frequently in microbial ecosystems. In this work, we
explore this problem by examining how the transient acquisition
of hypermutability affects inter- and intra-species
competitiveness, and the response to environmental insults such
as antibiotic challenge. We do this by engineering Pseudomonas
aeruginosa to allow the expression of an important mismatch
repair gene, mutS, to be experimentally controlled over a wide
dynamic range. We show that high levels of mutS expression induce
genomic stasis (hypomutation), whereas lower levels of induction
lead to progressively higher rates of mutation. Whole-genome
sequence analyses confirmed that the mutational spectrum of the
inducible hypermutator is similar to the distinctive profile
associated with mutS mutants obtained from the airways of people
with cystic fibrosis (CF). The acquisition of hypermutability
conferred a distinct temporal fitness advantage over the
wild-type P. aeruginosa progenitor strain, in both the presence
and the absence of an antibiotic selection pressure. However,
over a similar time-scale, acquisition of hypermutability had
little impact on the population dynamics of P. aeruginosa when
grown in the presence of a competing species (Staphylococcus
aureus). These data indicate that in the short term, acquired
hypermutability primarily confers a competitive intra-species
fitness advantage.},
