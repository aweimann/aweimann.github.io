abstract: Microorganisms play a primary role in regulating biogeochemical cycles and
  are a valuable source of enzymes that have biotechnological applications, such as
  carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). However, the inability to culture the majority
  of microorganisms that exist in natural ecosystems using common culture-dependent
  techniques restricts access to potentially novel cellulolytic bacteria and beneficial
  enzymes. The development of molecular-based culture-independent methods such as
  metagenomics enables researchers to study microbial communities directly from environmental
  samples, and presents a platform from which enzymes of interest can be sourced.
  We outline key methodological stages that are required as well as describe specific
  protocols that are currently used for metagenomic projects dedicated to CAZyme discovery.
