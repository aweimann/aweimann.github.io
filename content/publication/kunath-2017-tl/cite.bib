 abstract = {Microorganisms play a primary role in regulating biogeochemical
cycles and are a valuable source of enzymes that have
biotechnological applications, such as carbohydrate-active
enzymes (CAZymes). However, the inability to culture the
majority of microorganisms that exist in natural ecosystems
using common culture-dependent techniques restricts access to
potentially novel cellulolytic bacteria and beneficial enzymes.
The development of molecular-based culture-independent methods
such as metagenomics enables researchers to study microbial
communities directly from environmental samples, and presents a
platform from which enzymes of interest can be sourced. We
outline key methodological stages that are required as well as
describe specific protocols that are currently used for
metagenomic projects dedicated to CAZyme discovery.},
