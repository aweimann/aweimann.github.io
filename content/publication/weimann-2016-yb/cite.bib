 abstract = {The number of sequenced genomes is growing exponentially,
profoundly shifting the bottleneck from data generation to genome
interpretation. Traits are often used to characterize and
distinguish bacteria and are likely a driving factor in microbial
community composition, yet little is known about the traits of
most microbes. We describe Traitar, the microbial trait analyzer,
which is a fully automated software package for deriving
phenotypes from a genome sequence. Traitar provides phenotype
classifiers to predict 67 traits related to the use of various
substrates as carbon and energy sources, oxygen requirement,
morphology, antibiotic susceptibility, proteolysis, and enzymatic
activities. Furthermore, it suggests protein families associated
with the presence of particular phenotypes. Our method uses
L1-regularized L2-loss support vector machines for phenotype
assignments based on phyletic patterns of protein families and
their evolutionary histories across a diverse set of microbial
species. We demonstrate reliable phenotype assignment for Traitar
to bacterial genomes from 572 species of eight phyla, also based
on incomplete single-cell genomes and simulated draft genomes. We
also showcase its application in metagenomics by verifying and
complementing a manual metabolic reconstruction of two novel
Clostridiales species based on draft genomes recovered from
commercial biogas reactors. Traitar is available at
https://github.com/hzi-bifo/traitar. IMPORTANCE Bacteria are
ubiquitous in our ecosystem and have a major impact on human
health, e.g., by supporting digestion in the human gut. Bacterial
communities can also aid in biotechnological processes such as
wastewater treatment or decontamination of polluted soils.
Diverse bacteria contribute with their unique capabilities to the
functioning of such ecosystems, but lab experiments to
investigate those capabilities are labor-intensive. Major
advances in sequencing techniques open up the opportunity to
study bacteria by their genome sequences. For this purpose, we
have developed Traitar, software that predicts traits of bacteria
on the basis of their genomes. It is applicable to studies with
tens or hundreds of bacterial genomes. Traitar may help
researchers in microbiology to pinpoint the traits of interest,
reducing the amount of wet lab work required.},
