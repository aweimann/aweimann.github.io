              long-term, leads to impaired fitness due to its cumulative impact
              on the genome. This raises the question of why hypermutators
              arise so frequently in microbial ecosystems. In this work, we
              explore this problem by examining how the transient acquisition
              of hypermutability affects inter- and intra-species
              competitiveness, and the response to environmental insults such
              as antibiotic challenge. We do this by engineering Pseudomonas
              aeruginosa to allow the expression of an important mismatch
              repair gene, mutS, to be experimentally controlled over a wide
              dynamic range. We show that high levels of mutS expression induce
              genomic stasis (hypomutation), whereas lower levels of induction
              lead to progressively higher rates of mutation. Whole-genome
              sequence analyses confirmed that the mutational spectrum of the
              inducible hypermutator is similar to the distinctive profile
              associated with mutS mutants obtained from the airways of people
              with cystic fibrosis (CF). The acquisition of hypermutability
              conferred a distinct temporal fitness advantage over the
              wild-type P. aeruginosa progenitor strain, in both the presence
              and the absence of an antibiotic selection pressure. However,
              over a similar time-scale, acquisition of hypermutability had
              little impact on the population dynamics of P. aeruginosa when
              grown in the presence of a competing species (Staphylococcus
              aureus). These data indicate that in the short term, acquired
              hypermutability primarily confers a competitive intra-species
              fitness advantage.",

              genetic screen, we identify the Toll-like Receptor 8 (TLR8), as a
              key regulator of intracellular killing of Mtb. Pharmacological
              TLR8 activation enhances killing of phylogenetically diverse
              clinical isolates of drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant Mtb

              activated by phagosomal mycobacterial RNA released by
              extracellular membrane vesicles, and enhances xenophagy-dependent
              Mtb killing. We find that the TLR8 variant, M1V, common in far
              eastern populations, enhances intracellular killing of Mtb
              through preferential signal-dependent trafficking to phagosomes.

              there is currently no technique for the systematic determination
              of the genomic components of this process from these data.
              RESULTS: We describe a computational method for the discovery of
              the protein domains and CAZy families involved in microbial plant
              biomass degradation. Our method furthermore accurately predicts
              the capability to degrade plant biomass for microbial species
              from their genome sequences. Application to a large, manually
              curated data set of microbial degraders and non-degraders
              identified gene families of enzymes known by physiological and
              biochemical tests to be implicated in cellulose degradation, such
              as GH5 and GH6. Additionally, genes of enzymes that degrade other
              plant polysaccharides, such as hemicellulose, pectins and
              oligosaccharides, were found, as well as gene families which have
              not previously been related to the process. For draft genomes

              Bacteroidetes-affiliated species and a relative to a known plant
              biomass degrader to be plant biomass degraders. This was
              supported by the presence of genes encoding enzymatically active

               across different environments is one of the central questions in
               microbial ecology. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies are
               presently generating huge volumes of data to address this
               biogeographical topic. However, these studies are often focused
               on specific environment types or processes leading to the
               production of individual, unconnected datasets. The large
               amounts of legacy sequence data with associated metadata that
               exist can be harnessed to better place the genetic information
               found in these surveys into a wider environmental context. Here
               we introduce a software program, seqenv, to carry out precisely
               such a task. It automatically performs similarity searches of
               short sequences against the ``nt'' nucleotide database provided
               by NCBI and, out of every hit, extracts-if it is available-the
               textual metadata field. After collecting all the isolation
               sources from all the search results, we run a text mining
               algorithm to identify and parse words that are associated with
               the Environmental Ontology (EnvO) controlled vocabulary. This,
               in turn, enables us to determine both in which environments
               individual sequences or taxa have previously been observed and,
               by weighted summation of those results, to summarize complete
               samples. We present two demonstrative applications of seqenv to
               a survey of ammonia oxidizing archaea as well as to a plankton
               paleome dataset from the Black Sea. These demonstrate the
               ability of the tool to reveal novel patterns in HTS and its
               utility in the fields of environmental source tracking,

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Efficient industrial processes for converting plant
               lignocellulosic materials into biofuels are a key to global
               efforts to come up with alternative energy sources to fossil
               fuels. Novel cellulolytic enzymes have been discovered in
               microbial genomes and metagenomes of microbial communities.
               However, the identification of relevant genes without known
               homologs, and the elucidation of the lignocellulolytic pathways
               and protein complexes for different microorganisms remain
               challenging. RESULTS: We describe a new computational method for
               the targeted discovery of functional modules of plant
               biomass-degrading protein families, based on their co-occurrence
               patterns across genomes and metagenome datasets, and the
               strength of association of these modules with the genomes of
               known degraders. From approximately 6.4 million family
               annotations for 2,884 microbial genomes, and 332 taxonomic bins
               from 18 metagenomes, we identified 5 functional modules that are
               distinctive for plant biomass degraders, which we term ``plant
               biomass degradation modules'' (PDMs). These modules incorporate
               protein families involved in the degradation of cellulose,
               hemicelluloses, and pectins, structural components of the
               cellulosome, and additional families with potential functions in
               plant biomass degradation. The PDMs were linked to 81 gene
               clusters in genomes of known lignocellulose degraders, including
               previously described clusters of lignocellulolytic genes. On
               average, 70\% of the families of each PDM were found to map to
               gene clusters in known degraders, which served as an additional
               confirmation of their functional relationships. The presence of
               a PDM in a genome or taxonomic metagenome bin furthermore
               allowed us to accurately predict the ability of any particular
               organism to degrade plant biomass. For 15 draft genomes of a cow
               rumen metagenome, we used cross-referencing to confirmed
               cellulolytic enzymes to validate that the PDMs identified plant
               biomass degraders within a complex microbial community.
               CONCLUSIONS: Functional modules of protein families that are
               involved in different aspects of plant cell wall degradation can
               be inferred from co-occurrence patterns across (meta-)genomes
               with a probabilistic topic model. PDMs represent a new resource
               of protein families and candidate genes implicated in microbial
               plant biomass degradation. They can also be used to predict the
               plant biomass degradation ability for a genome or taxonomic bin.
               The method is also suitable for characterizing other microbial
               phenotypes.",

              profoundly shifting the bottleneck from data generation to genome

              community composition, yet little is known about the traits of

              classifiers to predict 67 traits related to the use of various
              substrates as carbon and energy sources, oxygen requirement,
              morphology, antibiotic susceptibility, proteolysis, and enzymatic

              ubiquitous in our ecosystem and have a major impact on human
              health, e.g., by supporting digestion in the human gut. Bacterial
              communities can also aid in biotechnological processes such as
              wastewater treatment or decontamination of polluted soils.
              Diverse bacteria contribute with their unique capabilities to the
              functioning of such ecosystems, but lab experiments to
              investigate those capabilities are labor-intensive. Major
              advances in sequencing techniques open up the opportunity to
              study bacteria by their genome sequences. For this purpose, we
              have developed Traitar, software that predicts traits of bacteria
              on the basis of their genomes. It is applicable to studies with
              tens or hundreds of bacterial genomes. Traitar may help

              methods for predicting antibiotic resistance from genomic
              sequence data have had lim- ited success due to their inability
              to model epistatic effects and generalize to novel variants.
              Here, we present GeneBac, a deep learning method for predicting
              antibiotic resistance from DNA sequence through the integration
              of interactions between genes. We apply GeneBac to two distinct

              similar processes must occur in bacterial lineages, potentially
